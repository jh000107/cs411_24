# First Idea: Exercise Routine and Diet Provider
Exercise Routine and Diet Provider is a web-based application that recommends exercise routines depending on their user profile (height, weight, body fat percentage, etc.) and the parts of body users want to exercise (shoulder, lower body, back, etc.) in respect to their profile using the exercise API and an appropriate diet using the food API. This project aims to deliver a convenient way for users to identify an ideal exercise routine for certain body parts and provide suggestions for a high protein diet.

1. It must utilize a database: require a user to store profile information in the database as suggested.
2. It must correlate at least two publicly available data sets via API from the Internet: food API and exercise API.
3. It must use third-party authentication: log in with some SNS as suggested.

# Second Idea: ChatGPT to Youtube Learning
ChatGPT to Youtube Learning is an innovative learning platform where users can ask questions by typing. This dual-source approach not only provides the learning experience for their query but also offers both textual explanations and video content for a comprehensive understanding.

1. It must utilize a database: require a user to store profile information, including their search history and preferences.
2. It must correlate at least two publicly available data sets via API from the Internet: use the GPT-4 API to fetch textual answers to user queries and use the YouTube API to fetch related educational video content based on keywords generated from the query.
3. It must use third-party authentication: allow users to log in using social media platforms or Google using OAuth.
